# Translation Management

Automated translation system for OpenObserve using AWS Translate.

## Overview

This system automatically translates the English locale file (`en.json`) into multiple languages **during the build process**. It intelligently preserves existing translations and only translates new keys, making it safe to run repeatedly.

## 🚀 How It Works

**Automatic workflow triggered by `en.json` changes:**

1. **Developer updates `en.json`** and pushes to any branch (main, develop, feature branches)
2. **GitHub Action detects the change** and automatically triggers
3. **Translation script runs** using AWS Translate to update all language files
4. **Changes are committed** back to the same branch automatically
5. **Build workflows use updated files** - all subsequent builds have fresh translations

This means **translations are always up-to-date** without any manual intervention!

## Supported Languages

- 🇹🇷 Turkish (tr)
- 🇨🇳 Chinese (zh)
- 🇫🇷 French (fr)
- 🇪🇸 Spanish (es)
- 🇩🇪 German (de)
- 🇮🇹 Italian (it)
- 🇵🇹 Portuguese (pt)
- 🇯🇵 Japanese (ja)
- 🇰🇷 Korean (ko)
- 🇳🇱 Dutch (nl)

## How It Works

1. **Source File**: All translations originate from `web/src/locales/languages/en.json`
2. **Translation**: New keys are automatically translated using AWS Translate
3. **Preservation**: Existing translations are never overwritten
4. **Nested Support**: Handles nested JSON structures correctly

## Local Development

### Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.11+**
2. **AWS Credentials** with access to AWS Translate service
3. **AWS CLI configured** or environment variables set

### Setup

```bash
# From the web directory
npm run translate:setup
```

Or manually:

```bash
cd scripts/translations
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### Configure AWS Credentials for Local Development

**Option 1 - AWS CLI (recommended):**
```bash
aws configure
```

**Option 2 - IAM Role (if running on EC2/ECS):**
```bash
# Uses instance profile automatically
# No configuration needed
```

**Option 3 - Environment variables:**
```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1
```

**Option 4 - Assume IAM Role locally:**
```bash
aws sts assume-role \
  --role-arn arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT_ID:role/GitHubActions-TranslationRole \
  --role-session-name local-translation

# Then export the credentials from the output
```

> **Note:** GitHub Actions uses OIDC and assumes the IAM role automatically. Local development can use any of the above methods.

### Running Translations

Translate all languages:
```bash
# From the web directory
npm run translate

# Or directly
cd scripts/translations
python3 main.py
```

Translate specific languages:
```bash
cd scripts/translations
python3 main.py fr es de
```

## GitHub Actions Workflow

### Automatic Translation Updates

The workflow (`.github/workflows/update-translations.yml`) automatically runs when:

- **Trigger**: Any push that modifies `web/src/locales/languages/en.json`
- **Branches**: **All branches** (`**`)
- **Action**:
  1. Runs Python translation script
  2. Updates all language JSON files
  3. Commits changes back to the same branch
  4. Subsequent builds use the updated files

### Setup Requirements

The workflow uses **IAM Role with OIDC** for secure, credential-less authentication.

#### IAM Role Configuration

The workflow is already configured to use:
- **IAM Role**: `arn:aws:iam::058694856476:role/GitHubActionsRole`
- **Region**: `us-east-1`

This is the same role used by other OpenObserve workflows (e.g., `build-pr-image.yml`).

#### Required IAM Permissions

Ensure the `GitHubActionsRole` has the following permission for AWS Translate:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "translate:TranslateText"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

> **Note:** If you need to add this permission, attach a policy to the existing `GitHubActionsRole` in AWS IAM Console.

#### GitHub Repository Setup

**No additional secrets required!** The workflow uses the existing OIDC configuration.

The role is already configured in the workflow file and will automatically authenticate via GitHub's OIDC provider.

### Workflow Behavior

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Push Code to Branch] --> B[Update Translations Workflow]
    B --> C{en.json Changed?}
    C -->|Yes| D[Run Translation Script]
    C -->|No| E[Skip Translation]
    D --> F[Commit Updated Languages]
    E --> G[Mark Complete]
    F --> G
    G --> H[Build Workflows Start]
    H --> I[Build with Latest Translations]
```

**Workflow Execution Order:**

1. **Push code** → `update-translations.yml` runs
2. Checks if `en.json` changed
   - If YES: Translates and commits back to branch
   - If NO: Skips (fast, ~10 seconds)
3. **If translations were committed** → New push event
4. **Build workflows trigger** on the new commit → Use updated translations

**Key Features:**
- ✅ **Always runs** - Checks every push for en.json changes
- ✅ **Smart detection** - Only translates if en.json actually changed
- ✅ **Non-blocking** - Quick skip if no translation needed
- ✅ **Auto-commit** - Updates committed back to same branch
- ✅ **Natural flow** - Translation commit triggers builds automatically
- ✅ **Works everywhere** - All branches (main, develop, feature branches)

### Manual Workflow Trigger

You can also run translations manually:

1. Go to **Actions** tab in GitHub
2. Select **Update Translations** workflow
3. Click **Run workflow**
4. (Optional) Specify specific languages: `fr es de`
5. Translations will be committed to the current branch

```

## Adding New Languages

1. Add language code to `get_supported_languages()` in `translator.py`
2. Update the README to reflect the new language
3. Run the translation script

## Troubleshooting

### Workflow Not Detecting en.json Changes

**Symptom:** You changed `en.json` but workflow says "en.json not modified"

**Solution 1 - Check workflow logs:**
1. Go to **Actions** → **Update Translations** → Click the run
2. Look at "Check if en.json was modified" step
3. It shows debug info: event type, before/after SHAs, and changed files

**Solution 2 - Use force flag:**
1. Go to **Actions** → **Update Translations**
2. Click **Run workflow**
3. Check **"Force translation even if en.json not detected as changed"**
4. Click **Run workflow**

**Solution 3 - Debug detection:**
```bash
# Locally check what git sees
git show --name-only --pretty="" HEAD
# Should show web/src/locales/languages/en.json

# Check last push
git diff HEAD~1 --name-only
```

**Root cause:** The detection uses `git diff` to compare commits. If:
- Multiple commits in one push → Uses `github.event.before` and `github.sha`
- First commit on branch → Uses `git show HEAD`
- Manual trigger → Uses `git show HEAD`

### AWS Credentials Error
```
ERROR: No credentials for the translation service.
```
**Solution**: IAM role should be automatically assumed via OIDC. Check:
1. Workflow has `permissions: id-token: write`
2. Role ARN is correct: `arn:aws:iam::058694856476:role/GitHubActionsRole`
3. Role has `translate:TranslateText` permission

### Import Error
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'boto3'
```
**Solution**: Run `npm run translate:setup` or `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

### Translation Quality Issues
- Machine translations are not perfect
- Review translations before merging PRs
- Consider manual review for critical UI text
- Native speakers should review translations

### Build Has Old Translations

**Symptom:** Build doesn't have the latest translations

**Solution:** Check if translation workflow ran and committed:
1. Go to **Actions** → Find the **Update Translations** run
2. Check if it detected en.json changes and committed translations
3. If translations were committed, the commit should trigger a new build
4. The new build will have updated translations

## Workflow Example

### Scenario: Adding New UI Text

1. **Developer adds new text to `en.json`:**
   ```json
   {
     "dashboard": {
       "newFeature": "This is a new feature"
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Merge the `en.json` change to `main`:**
   ```bash
   git add web/src/locales/languages/en.json
   git commit -m "feat: add new dashboard feature text"
   # open a PR and merge to main
   ```

3. **Workflow automatically (on `main` only):**
   - Triggers because `web/src/locales/languages/en.json` changed
   - Runs translation script
   - Translates only the **new or modified** keys to all 10 languages
   - Commits updated `fr.json`, `es.json`, etc. plus `.translation_state.json`

4. **Build workflows:**
   - Use the newly updated translation files
   - No additional steps needed

> **Why `main` only?** Running on every feature branch made AWS Translate bill for
> the same strings repeatedly (per branch, per rebase, again on merge). Gating to
> `main` translates each string once, when it actually lands.

## Change detection (`.translation_state.json`)

`scripts/translations/.translation_state.json` records, per locale, a hash of the
English source each translated value was derived from. On every run the script:

- **Translates** a key only when it is new, missing in a target file, or its English
  source text changed since the last run (so editing an existing label re-translates it).
- **Keeps** already-translated text whose source is unchanged — it is never re-sent to
  AWS, and English is never "translated" to English.
- **Prunes** keys that were removed from `en.json`.
- **Bootstraps** safely: the first run after this file is introduced adopts existing
  translations as-is (no costly full re-translation, no overwriting manual fixes).

Commit `.translation_state.json` together with the translation files — it is the
source of truth that keeps subsequent runs incremental.

## Best Practices

1. **Review Commits**: Check auto-generated translation commits for accuracy
2. **Test in UI**: Verify translations display correctly in the application
3. **Manual Fixes**: Manual edits to a key are preserved until its English source changes
4. **Context Matters**: Some terms may need manual translation for proper context
5. **Land on `main`**: Translations are generated when `en.json` is merged to `main`

## Cost Considerations

AWS Translate pricing (as of 2024):
- **$15 per million characters**

### Cost Per Workflow Run:

| Update Type | Characters | Languages | Total Chars | Cost |
|-------------|-----------|-----------|-------------|------|
| Small (10 strings) | 500 | 10 | 5,000 | $0.08 |
| Medium (50 strings) | 2,500 | 10 | 25,000 | $0.38 |
| Large (200 strings) | 10,000 | 10 | 100,000 | $1.50 |
| Full translation | 60,000 | 10 | 600,000 | $9.00 |

### Monthly Estimates:

**Active Development:**
- 10-15 `en.json` updates/month
- Average 20 new strings per update
- **Monthly cost: $0.80 - $1.20**

**Production:**
- 5-8 `en.json` updates/month
- Average 15 new strings per update
- **Monthly cost: $0.40 - $0.80**

**First-time full translation:** ~$9 (one-time)

### Cost Optimization:
- ✅ Only **new or modified** keys are translated (unchanged text is never re-sent)
- ✅ Runs on **`main` only**, and only when `en.json` changes (no per-branch re-billing)
- ✅ Superseded runs are cancelled (`concurrency` with `cancel-in-progress`)
- ✅ Safety cap (`TRANSLATION_MAX_KEYS`, default 5000) blocks accidental mass re-translation
- ✅ Failed AWS calls are retried next run, not silently billed as English
- ✅ Typical monthly cost: **Under $2**
