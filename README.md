ðŸš€ 10x easier, ðŸš€ 10x cheaper, ðŸš€ petabyte scale - Elasticsearch alternative for ðŸš€ (logs, metrics, traces).

ZincObserve is a search engine built specifically for logs , metrics & traces search & analytics. One can use it to search & analyze terabytes of data.

## Features:
1. Best in class GUI.
1. Single binary for installation & running. Binaries available under [releases](https://github.com/zinclabs/zincobserve/releases) for multiple platforms.
1. SQL for sophisticated queries, no need to learn yet another query language.
1. Embedded scripting functions for ingestion & query to aid advanced capabilities like enrichment, redaction, log reduction, compliance, etc.
1. Dynamic Schema

## Installation
You would need ZO_ROOT_USER_EMAIL and ZO_ROOT_USER_PASSWORD environment variables when you start ZincObserve for the first time. You don't need them on subsequent runs of ZincObserve.

Binaries can be downloaded from [releases page](https://github.com/zinclabs/zincobserve/releases) for appropriate platform.

### For Windows use : 

        set ZO_ROOT_USER_EMAIL=admin@zinc.dev
        set ZO_ROOT_USER_PASSWORD=Complexpass#123
        zinc.exe

### For MacOS/Linux use :
   
        ZO_ROOT_USER_EMAIL=admin@zinc.dev ZO_ROOT_USER_PASSWORD=Complexpass#123 ./zincobserve 
   

Now point your browser to [http://localhost:5080](http://localhost:5080) and login using user ZO_ROOT_USER_EMAIL & ZO_ROOT_USER_PASSWORD


## How to get support
Easiest way to get support is to join the [Slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/zincsearch/shared_invite/zt-11r96hv2b-UwxUILuSJ1duzl_6mhJwVg).

## Quick Start

```
ZO_ROOT_USER_EMAIL="admin@zinc.dev" ZO_ROOT_USER_PASSWORD="Complexpass#123" cargo run
```

## Etcd client

etcd-client which is used by zincobserve needs protocol buffer compiler, please refer https://grpc.io/docs/protoc-installation/

For MacOS,using Homebrew

brew install protobuf

protoc --version

## Application structure

User -> API Interface -> Protocol{http|grpc|job} -> Services{logs|metrics|traces|users} -> Infra{db|storage|config} -> meta | common{thirdparty|function utils}

## init

1. register cluster
2. load cache
3. start move job
4. start file list
5. start grpc
6. start http
7. change node status to online

## Mimalloc

We use [Mimalloc](https://github.com/microsoft/mimalloc) replaced jemalloc.

But default we didn't enable it, if you want enable should add cargo flags like this:

```
RUSTFLAGS='-C target-cpu=native' cargo build --release --features "mimalloc"
```

if you want better control to release memory quickly, you can set some evironments

```
export MIMALLOC_VERBOSE=1
export MIMALLOC_PAGE_RESET=1
export MIMALLOC_DECOMMIT_DELAY=25
```

More options refer to: https://github.com/microsoft/mimalloc#environment-options

## Format code

```
cargo clippy -- -A clippy::uninlined_format_args
```

## check cargo build feature

```
diff -u <(rustc --print cfg) <(rustc -C target-cpu=native --print cfg)
```
