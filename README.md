# ZincObserve
ZincObserve is a cloud native observability platform built specifically for logs, metrics, traces and analytics designed to work at petabyte scale.

It is very simple and easy to operate as opposed to Elasticsearch which requires a couple dozen knobs to understand and tune which you can get up and running in under 2 minutes.

It is a drop-in replacement for Elasticsearch if you are just ingesting data using APIs and searching using kibana (Kibana is not supported nor required with ZincObserve. ZincObserve provides its own UI which does not require separate installation unlike kibana).

You can reduce your log storage costs by ~140x compared to Elasticsearch by using ZincObserve. Below are the results when we pushed logs from our production kubernetes cluster to Elasticsearch and ZincObserve using fluentbit. ZincObserve stored data in Amazon s3 and Elasticsearch stored data on Amazon EBS volumes.
