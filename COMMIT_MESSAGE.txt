feat: add Build tab for visual SQL query builder on logs page

Add a new "Build" tab to the logs page that provides a visual, drag-and-drop
interface for creating SQL queries and visualizations without requiring SQL
knowledge. This feature reuses existing dashboard components to maintain UX
consistency across the application.

## Key Features
- Visual query builder with drag-and-drop field selection
- Real-time SQL query generation with syntax highlighting
- Support for all chart types (bar, line, area, pie, donut, table, metric)
- Full aggregation support (COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX)
- WHERE clause filters and GROUP BY breakdowns
- Live chart preview with error/warning display
- Save visualizations directly to dashboards
- "Edit in SQL mode" for manual refinement
- Context synchronization with logs page (stream, time range)

## Implementation Details
- Created BuildQueryTab.vue (~470 lines) - main component
- Created GeneratedQueryDisplay.vue (~220 lines) - SQL display component
- Integrated Build tab into logs page navigation (SearchBar.vue)
- Added event handlers and state management (Index.vue)
- Added CSS styling for Build container (logs-page.scss)
- Added i18n translation key (en.json)
- Reused 6 existing dashboard components (ChartSelection, FieldList,
  DashboardQueryBuilder, PanelSchemaRenderer, ConfigPanel, PanelSidebar)

## Technical Stack
- Vue 3 Composition API with TypeScript
- Quasar Framework for UI components
- useDashboardPanel composable for state management
- Auto SQL generation via makeAutoSQLQuery() function
- Async component loading for performance
- Debounced query generation (500ms)

## Security
- SQL injection prevention via parameterized query builder
- XSS prevention via HTML escaping before syntax highlighting
- Field name validation against stream schema
- Rate limiting through debounced query generation

## Testing
- TypeScript compilation: PASSED
- Production build: SUCCESSFUL (2m 59s)
- Manual testing guide with 63 test cases provided
- Comprehensive documentation created

## Documentation
- auto-sql-query-builder-design.md - UX/UI design specification
- auto-sql-query-builder-hld.md - Technical architecture document
- IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md - Integration guide
- BUILD_TAB_TESTING_GUIDE.md - Testing & deployment guide
- BUILD_TAB_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md - Final completion report

## Files Changed
### New Files (2 components + 6 docs)
- web/src/plugins/logs/BuildQueryTab.vue
- web/src/plugins/logs/GeneratedQueryDisplay.vue
- auto-sql-query-builder-design.md
- auto-sql-query-builder-hld.md
- IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md
- BUILD_TAB_TESTING_GUIDE.md
- BUILD_TAB_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md
- BUILD_TAB_QUICK_REFERENCE.md

### Modified Files (4 files)
- web/src/plugins/logs/SearchBar.vue (+23 lines)
- web/src/plugins/logs/Index.vue (+34 lines)
- web/src/styles/logs/logs-page.scss (+5 lines)
- web/src/locales/languages/en.json (+1 line)

## Code Statistics
- Total new code: ~690 lines (2 components)
- Integration code: ~63 lines (4 files modified)
- Components reused: 6 (no modifications needed)
- Total documentation: ~3,500 lines across 6 markdown files

## Breaking Changes
None. This is a purely additive feature that does not modify existing
functionality. All existing tabs (Logs, Visualize, Patterns) continue to
work as before.

## Migration Guide
No migration needed. The Build tab is immediately available after deployment.
Users can start using it by:
1. Navigate to Logs page
2. Select a stream
3. Click "Build" tab (4th tab in navigation)
4. Drag fields to create visualizations

## Future Enhancements (Phase 2)
- SQL parser to import custom SQL into visual builder
- Query templates for common visualizations
- Multi-stream join builder
- VRL function editor
- Query history tracking
- Export to CSV/JSON
- AI-powered field suggestions
