# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical test failures in the OpenObserve web application that are preventing the test suite from passing. The failures include Vue.js compiler warnings, localStorage mocking issues, and undefined property access errors in component tests. These issues need to be resolved to maintain code quality and ensure reliable testing.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Vue.js compiler warnings to be resolved, so that the build process is clean and follows current Vue 3 best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the DateTimePicker.vue component is compiled THEN the system SHALL NOT show warnings about importing `defineEmits`
2. WHEN any Vue component uses compiler macros THEN the system SHALL follow Vue 3.3+ conventions without explicit imports

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want ThemeSwitcher component tests to handle localStorage edge cases properly, so that tests are reliable and don't fail due to localStorage availability issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN localStorage.getItem throws an error THEN the ThemeSwitcher component SHALL handle the error gracefully without crashing
2. WHEN localStorage.setItem throws an error THEN the ThemeSwitcher component SHALL handle the error gracefully without crashing
3. WHEN localStorage is not available THEN the component tests SHALL mock localStorage properly and not throw unhandled errors
4. WHEN testing localStorage edge cases THEN the test suite SHALL verify error handling without causing test failures

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want IndexList component tests to properly initialize component properties, so that tests can access and modify component state without undefined property errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN IndexList component is mounted in tests THEN the `streamSchemaFieldsIndexMapping` property SHALL be properly initialized
2. WHEN tests attempt to set properties on `streamSchemaFieldsIndexMapping` THEN the property SHALL exist and be writable
3. WHEN adding fields to interesting field list THEN the test SHALL successfully modify the component state
4. WHEN removing fields from interesting field list THEN the test SHALL successfully modify the component state
5. WHEN component is initialized THEN all required properties for testing SHALL be available and properly typed

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all test suites to pass consistently, so that the CI/CD pipeline remains stable and code quality is maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running the complete test suite THEN all 4 currently failing tests SHALL pass
2. WHEN tests are executed THEN no unhandled errors SHALL be thrown during component mounting or property access
3. WHEN localStorage mocking is used THEN the mocks SHALL properly simulate both success and error scenarios
4. WHEN Vue components are tested THEN the test setup SHALL properly initialize all required component properties
